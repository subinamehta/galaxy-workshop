      Terrestrial ecosystem models have been widely used to study the impact of
      climate changes on vegetation and terrestrial biogeochemical cycles in
      climate modelling community. They are also more and more applied in
      ecological studies to help ecologists to better understand the processes.
      But the technical challenges are still too high for most of the
      ecologists to use them. This practical aims at familiarizing you
      (especially ecologists) with running a terrestrial ecosystem model (i.e.,
      CLM-FATES) at site-level in Galaxy and analyzing the model results.

computational-chemistry-cheminformatics-tutorial:
  description: |
    Cheminformatics is the use of computational techniques and information
    about molecules to solve problems in chemistry. This involves a number of
    steps: retrieving data on chemical compounds, sorting data for properties which
    are of interest, and extracting new information. This tutorial will provide a
    brief overview of all of these, centered around protein-ligand docking, a
    molecular modelling technique.

      guide to using GROMACS (Abraham et al. 2015) in Galaxy to prepare and perform
      molecular dynamics on a small protein. For the tutorial, we will perform our
      simulations on hen egg white lysozyme.

epigenetics-atac-seq-tutorial:
  description: |
      In many eukaryotic organisms, such as humans, the genome is tightly
      packed and organized with the help of nucleosomes (chromatin). A
      nucleosome is a complex formed by eight histone proteins that is wrapped
      with ~147bp of DNA. When the DNA is being actively transcribed into RNA,
      the DNA will be opened and loosened from the nucleosome complex. Many
      factors, such as the chromatin structure, the position of the
      nucleosomes, and histone modifications, play an important role in the
      organization and accessibility of the DNA. Consequently, these factors
      are also important for the activation and inactivation of genes. Assay
      for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq) is a
      method to investigate the accessibility of chromatin and thus a method to
      determine regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. The method can help
      identify promoter regions and potential enhancers and silencers.

      genes, i.e. tRNA, rRNA) present on on a sequence. Prokka can be used to
      annotate bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes quickly, generating
      standard output files in GenBank, EMBL and gff formats.

  type: Tutorial
  description: Metatranscriptomics analysis examines how the microbiome responds to the environment by studying the taxonomic composition and functional analysis of genes expressed by the microbiome, using microbial community RNASeq data and subsequent metatranscriptomics workflows. This workshop will introduce researchers to the basic concepts and tools from the ASaiM-MT workflow. ASaiM-MT provides a curated collection of tools to explore and visualize taxonomic and functional information from metatranscriptomic sequences.

proteogenomics-intro:
  description: |
      In this opening presentation, the basic components of proteogenomics are
      described, including the main steps in the bioinformatics analysis
      workflow that make up this approach and will be detailed in the following
      tutorials. Some examples of research questions that benefit from a
      proteogenomics approach are also highlighted.

      A biomarker is a measurable biological component that can be routinely
      detected in clinical practice and reflects a disease state, response to
      therapeutic treatment, or other relevant biological state. In this
      tutorial we introduce successively the tools of this pipeline, and guide
      you to execute them in order to complete the entire pipeline on a
      concrete example.

proteomics-maxquant-msstats-dda-lfq:
  description: |
      Modern mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables the identification
      and quantification of thousands of proteins. Therefore, quantitative mass spectrometry
      represents an indispensable technology for biological and clinical research.
      Statistical analyses are required for the unbiased answering of scientific questions
      and to uncover all important information in the proteomic data. In this training
      we will cover the full analysis workflow from label-free, data dependent acquisition
      (DDA) raw data to statistical results. We'll use two popular quantitative
      proteomics software: MaxQuant and MSstats.

      In this tutorial, we will provide a walkthrough on how to generate a

      FASTA database contains sequences with single amino acid variants (SAVs),
      insertions and deletions (indels)and transcript assemblies (splicing
      variants). This database can then be used to identify protein sequence
      variants from the mass spectrometry data.

transcriptomics-scrna-scanpy-pbmc3k:
  description: |
      In this tutorial, we will investigate clustering of single-cell data from
      10x Genomics, including preprocessing, clustering and the identification
      of cell types via known marker genes, using Scanpy. It will be
      illustrated using a dataset of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC),
      containing 2,700 single cells. Please work through the full tutorial
      yourself to get all the details.

      of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is associated with changes in phenotype, for example
      drug resistance and virulence. It is also useful for outbreak investigation
      as the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample can be used to build
      a phylogeny.
